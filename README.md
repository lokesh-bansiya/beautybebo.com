## My first Project In Masai School
<h2>Clone of beautybebo.com website</h2>
<div>
   This clone was assigned to me during my first construct week in Masai. I had to build a clone of the beauybebo.com website at the end of my second unit, at that phase I learned Advanced JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We had 4 days to complete this project. According to that I have divided my task to 8 issues and again I divided my issues to smaller tasks (31 tasks) and with the help of all this mapping of the project before jumping on the code made my thought process easy and I was able to complete this project on time.
